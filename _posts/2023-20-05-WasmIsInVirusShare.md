# What is VirusShare ?

TODO, How many samples ? From which date ? How can you access it ?

# Can we find Wasm inside this dataset ?

TODO, We work on Wasm. We were curious, we crawl all samples to find for Wasm.
How we do it? Check the Wasm magic number. What are the limitations of this method? Threats to validitty of this blog post.

How many we have found? ~5000

We then categorize them. All are obfuscating JS code.

How is it obfuscating?

# What can we conclude on this ?


Wasm as malicious is used for X.
