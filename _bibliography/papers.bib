 abstract={The comparison and alignment of runtime traces are essential, e.g., for semantic analysis or debugging. However, naive sequence alignment algorithms cannot address the needs of the modern web: (i) the bytecode generation process of V8 is not deterministic; (ii) bytecode traces are large.
We present STRAC, a scalable and extensible tool tailored to compare bytecode traces generated by the V8 JavaScript engine. Given two V8 bytecode traces and a distance function between trace events, STRAC computes and provides the best alignment. The key insight is to split access between memory and disk. STRAC can identify semantically equivalent web pages and is capable of processing huge V8 bytecode traces whose order of magnitude matches today's web like this https URL, which generates approx. 150k of V8 bytecode instructions. },

  abstract = {Edge-Cloud computing offloads parts of the computations that traditionally occurs in the cloud to edge nodes. The binary format WebAssembly is increasingly used to distribute and deploy services on such platforms. Edge-Cloud computing providers let their clients deploy stateless services in the form of WebAssembly binaries, which are then translated to machine code, sandboxed and executed at the edge. In this context, we propose a technique that (i) automatically diversifies WebAssembly binaries that are deployed to the edge and (ii) randomizes execution paths at runtime. Thus, an attacker cannot exploit all edge nodes with the same payload. Given a service, we automatically synthesize functionally equivalent variants for the functions providing the service. All the variants are then wrapped into a single multivariant WebAssembly binary. When the service endpoint is executed, every time a function is invoked, one of its variants is randomly selected. We implement this technique in the MEWE tool and we validate it with 7 services for which MEWE generates multivariant binaries that embed hundreds of function variants. We execute the multivariant binaries on the world-wide edge platform provided by Fastly, as part as a research collaboration. We show that multivariant binaries exhibit a real diversity of execution traces across the whole edge platform distributed around the globe.},

    abstract={The adoption of WebAssembly has rapidly increased in the last few years as it provides a fast and safe model for program execution. However, WebAssembly is not exempt from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by side channels attacks. This class of vulnerabilities that can be addressed by code diversification. In this paper, we present the first fully automated workflow for the diversification of WebAssembly binaries. We present CROW, an open-source tool implementing this workflow. We evaluate CROW's capabilities on 303 C programs and study its use on a real-life security-sensitive program: libsodium, a cryptographic library. Overall, CROW is able to generate diverse variants for 239 out of 303 (79%) small programs. On libsodium, the execution trace changes up to 83.4%. },

  title = {WebAssembly Diversification for Malware Evasion},
  year = {2022},
  abstract = {WebAssembly is a binary format that has become an essential component of the web nowadays. Pro-
viding a faster alternative to JavaScript in the browser, this new technology has been embraced from
its early days to create cryptomalware. This has triggered a solid effort to propose defenses that can
detect WebAssembly malware. Yet, no defensive work has assumed that attackers would use evasion
techniques. In this paper, we study how to evade WebAssembly cryptomalware detectors. We pro-
pose a novel evasion technique based on a state-of-the-art WebAssembly binary diversifier. We use
the worldwide authoritative VirusTotal as malware detector to evaluate our technique. Our results
demonstrate that it is possible to automatically generate variants of WebAssembly cryptomalware,
which evade the considered strong detector. Remarkably, the variants introduce limited performance
overhead. Our experiments also provide novel insights about which WebAssembly code transforma-
tions are the best suited for malware evasion. This provides insights for the community to improve
the state of the art of WebAssembly malware detection.}
