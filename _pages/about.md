I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, more specifically, I am doing Software Randomization for Security. I am a team member of the Trustworthy Fullstack Computing (<a href="https://www.trustfull.proj.kth.se/">TRUSTFULL</a>) project.

          <p>In this work we proposed a data augmentation
              technique using a novel mutation tool for WebAssembly that
              provides semantically equivalent code transformations. We re-
              produce MINOS, a novel tool to automatically detect malicious
              WebAssembly programs. We empirically demonstrate that the
              original dataset of MINOS is too small to be generalized.
              The MINOS model trained with the original dataset dropped
              its accuracy to 50% on the augmented datasets. Besides, the
              model does not improve when it uses the augmented dataset
              for training. Thus, we show that the proposed normalization
              process in MINOS is affected under depth data transformations
              for WebAssembly.
